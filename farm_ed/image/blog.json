        "Description": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.                                                                                                 Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.                                                               Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.                                                               Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public.                       In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.                                                                                                The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours.                       As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.                                                                                                For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.                                                              The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters. ClimSA is another tool that will be life-saving to farmers and rural Burkinabe people who may be in a storm's path. But, unfortunately, developed countries need to do more not only to finance but to transition into a zero-carbon economy.                                                                                             https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries                                                              https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2022/11/09/cop27-burkina-faso-uses-improved-methods-to-predict-rainfall-and-extreme-weather-events_6003529_124.html                                                              https://www.carbonbrief.org/west-africas-deadly-rainfall-in-2022-made-80-times-more-likely-by-climate-change/",

Africa’s vast and diverse wilderness is breathtaking but disappearing, and her population is growing but unstable. Yet, through all the hardships faced on the continent, the everyday people of Africa have shown their resilience and ability to keep looking forward, not giving up no matter the difficulties they face.

Although, what has remained true is modern humans’ first continent, Africa. It is here that the entire world as we know it started. Ninety thousand years ago, the first people migrated out of Africa to explore a new world and create new cultures, languages, and technologies. One of these developments was one that completely changed the way humans lived, domestication.                                                                         As hunter-gatherers, humans migrated alongside their food. They had no permanent settlements, and everyone worked together to feed their small tribe. Eventually, agriculture started to seep into the lives of people. The exact time and way ancient humans first domesticated plants and animals is still not known. Archaeologists believed that once a tribe learned about agriculture, they switched entirely and that this way of life spread worldwide, hence the name agricultural revolution. However, recently this theory has been disproven. Some tribes in Africa kept to their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, while others took a hybrid approach. Archeological records also indicate that humans discovered agriculture around the late stone age when people carved stones into specific shapes for weapons and tools.                                                              Another misconception many people have is that the discovery of agricultural production happened in one place. In reality, cultures worldwide discovered domestication in multiple places, but the exact process of how it came about will never be known. However, archeologists and historians have a consensus on the most likely way plant and animal domestication was discovered.                                                              It is believed that the gatherers of the tribe started to protect certain crops, mostly cereals like sorghum and millets. People would protect the crops by weeding and resowing their seeds. Gatherers soon found that resowing healthier crops produced better crops the following year. True domestication came when a family of crops became dependent on human intervention. As the years went by, the plant would no longer be able to compete with weeds but would produce a much higher yield.                                                              The same process took place with the domestication of wild animals. Again, the members of the tribe would protect the healthier wild animals. The animals would be herded together and brought to better grazing sites to increase their size. Larger animals produced more milk and meat, but the animals now required human assistance to survive. The agricultural revolution was long and drawn out, but its impacts changed humans’ entire understanding of the world!                                                              People around the world and in Africa started settling. Instead of makeshift shelters, people began to use mud, thatch, and even stones to create permanent housing. With the rise of agriculture, people began to develop better tools, use them, and be able to store them. They were no longer restricted to only taking what they could carry on their backs. Even more importantly, as people began settling in fertile regions and having a reliable food source, they had more children. Once seen as a burden to carry and care for, the entire family helped raise newborn babies. They would soon be in the fields helping their family with the harvest. Families also gained access to a surplus. If families were able to produce more than they could consume, they would have food security through bad harvests or severe weather. They would also be able to trade with artisans for other goods.                                                              Agriculture completely changed the way human beings interacted with their environment. They no longer lived in harmony with nature, migrating with the weather and animals. This surplus quickly started to create classes between rich and poor. However, this change was much more gradual than recently believed. Many early farming communities still relied heavily on hunting. Some communities simply domesticated animals, migrating to the best feeding spots every season. Archaeologists believe that most of Africa’s traditional religions gained a spiritual element during the agricultural revolution. People now had to rely on the weather and the varying climate. This brought about prayers for rain, fertility, and a good harvest.                                                              Plant and animal domestication was a long and slow process but soon took over every corner of the world. It became embedded in ancient people’s lifestyles and religions. The agricultural revolution was a significant turning point in the history of homo sapiens. We still rely heavily on farm production, and FarmSahel is working to ensure farmers can produce crops for generations.

        "Description": "On August 5th, Burkina Faso celebrated its 62nd Independence Day! Colonial rule was brutal to the African people, and it decimated cultures. Luckily, the people of Burkina Faso stood tall against French rule and are still able to practice those ancient traditions that their ancestors participated in generations ago.                                                                         It wasn’t until Thomas Sankara took power in 1983 in a bloodless coup when The Republic of Upper Volta officially became Burkina Faso. Sankara chose the name Burkina Faso from two of the country’s most common languages. As an attempt to drive away corruption and gain greater autonomy from foreign influence, the name roughly translates to ‘Land of Honest People.’ Unfortunately, the political situation of Burkina Faso has not improved with continued coups, violence, and poverty. However, the Burkinabe people have never waivered and continue practicing their traditional culture, especially in rural areas.                                                              While French is the official language of Burkina Faso, there are over 70 languages throughout the country, 60 of which are indigenous to the region. Each of these languages has its own myths, spiritual traditions, and cultures which survived the onslaught of western colonization. Overall, the traditional beliefs of many indigenous cultures differ from western cultures. Burkina Faso’s traditional ideas focus on an inter-dependence between communities and living in harmony with nature. Traditional culture focuses on living well, not living better, which helps deter conflict between ethnic groups.                                                              With such deep roots in traditional culture, Burkina Faso is rich in music, clothing, and rituals. Traditional music often consisted of drums, flutes, and stringed instruments. In addition, in the west of the country, an instrument called the balophon is made with dried gourds. Dancers usually accompany music in colorful costumes. Music is such an important aspect of traditional culture that Burkina Faso holds a biennial festival called the International Festival of Masks and the Arts or FESTIMA.                                                              The International Festival of Masks and the Arts started in 1996 and occurs every other year, falling on even years. The fifteenth festival took place in early March 2020 and lasted several days. The festival is held in Burkina Faso, the most recent in Bankuy. Thousands of people come to see dancers in traditional clothes and masks perform ancient rituals from west African countries. There is usually a translator at the festival to help interpret the dance being performed. While music and dance are integral to the traditional culture of Burkina Faso, this festival focuses on the protection of Masks that are very important to the Mossi ethnic group.                                                              The Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso, accounting for about 52% of the population. The ancient Mossi empire controlled a large portion of the center of Upper Volta. The Nyonyose, farmers and spiritual segments of ancient Mossi culture, used masks in rituals and religious observances. Archaeologists found that the Mossi primarily used masks at burials, especially for leading elders and chiefs. Rituals would be performed continuously after an elder had died since elders had the most respect in the Mossi hierarchical system. It is believed that Masks allowed the spirit to pass into the world of ancestors. It is believed without a proper funeral the spirit would cause trouble for their descendants. Thick, vibrant costumes accompanied masks. Masks are still sacred in many traditional parts of Burkina Faso and are seen as a link to spirits and nature.                                                              These traditional parts of Burkina Faso are usually rural regions. They have relied on oral tradition to pass down poems, folk tales, songs, and more. It wasn’t until late into colonization that written literature came to the Burkinabe people, some of whom started to write down oral stories, mostly from the Mossi ethnic group.                                                              While cultural tradition and language have survived colonial rule, new problems are bringing Burkina Faso’s rich culture into demise. Most notably, young people are flocking to cities to find higher-paying jobs. These cities do not follow the traditional culture and are much more westernized. Second, the noble aspects of traditional Burkina Faso culture are disappearing as life becomes more difficult for the rural population. Third, climate change, internally displaced people, and terrorism forced some groups to have forgotten about living well and in harmony with nature.                                                              FarmSahel hopes to continue or bring back that ancient tradition of living in harmony with nature. Our programs are designed to help mitigate the effect of climate change, allow villages to better absorb the impact of migrants, and bring harmony back between the agriculturalists and their land.                                                                                                                            https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2016/3/13/in-burkina-faso-festima-a-festival-of-african-masks                               https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/burkina-faso/history-and-culture                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossi_people#:~:text=The%20Mossi)%20are%20a%20Gur,or%20about%2011.1%20million%20people.                               https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-culture-of-burkina-faso.html                               https://barkafoundation.org/burkina-faso-history-culture-climate-people-more/",

        "Description": "Around the world, National parks are protecting sea creatures, insects, and fauna alike. In Burkina Faso, five national parks preserve the beauty of West African wildlife. One of the oldest National parks in Burkina Faso is called the Mare aux Hippopotames.                                                                         Established in 1937, the Mare aux Hippopotames became the only UNESCO Biosphere reserve in the nation. Formally established in 1977 and translated to ‘Lake of Hippopotamuses,’ it was created around a freshwater lake with other pools and marshes. It spans about 19,200 ha covering the floodplain of the black volta river. While the park’s main feature is the lake it is named after, the surrounding and protected galley forests have the most beneficial impact on the larger ecosystem. Galley forests form corridors along waterways, growing trees in regions that do not typically support tree growth. In these galley forests, Elephants, antelopes, primates, and hundreds of bird species can roam free. In addition, in the freshwater lake, crocodiles and a large population of hippopotamuses bring tourists to the region. Located in the southwest of Burkina Faso, the wildlife of Mare aux Hippopotames sees only four months of rainy weather, making the protection of the freshwater lake vital to the ecosystem.                                                              Moving east in Burkina Faso, located just north of the border of Ghana, is the second National Park of Burkina Faso, Kaborè Tambi National Park. Founded in 1976, the park follows the Nazinon river covering 155,500 ha. The large stretch of land has become a safe haven for wildlife, particularly birds, in Burkina Faso. But unfortunately, the park is not immune to poachers. In 1991, a ranger lost his life to poachers, and the park was renamed in his honor.                                                              Poachers have been a major issue throughout Africa since the discovery of ivory. Focusing on elephants, poachers are debilitating the population. The Deux Balès National Park was once home to the largest population of elephants in Burkina Faso in 2001. In 1937, as part of French West Africa, the area was named the Deux Balès Classified Forests. Unfortunately, the name is misleading, for this area was never designated as a national park. The area of the park ranges anywhere from 61,000 ha to 81,000 ha. While it is no longer home to a large population of elephants, the park is home to various flora. Most notably aging baobab trees. Native to Africa, baobab trees are widespread and can live up to 2,000 years. While this park is a haven for vegetation, without proper management, protection, and designation as a national park, wildlife continues to be threatened.                                                              The last set of national parks is a joint effort by multiple countries in West Africa. The first, Arli National Park, is located on the far east side of Burkina Faso, linking up with Benin’s Pendjari National Park. The Arli National Park holds a portion of the habitat home to Burkina Faso’s elephant population. The park is also home to hippopotamuses, lions, woodlands, gallery forests, and sandstone hills.                                                              Just north of Arli is W National Park, a major national park in West Africa encompassing three countries: Burkina Faso, Niger, and Bennin. Formally established in 1954, the park follows a bend of the River Niger that outlines a ‘W’ where the park gets its name. While the area is largely uninhabited due to wetlands that create a malaria zone, archaeological discoveries have shown humans once occupied the area. W National Park is significant not only for the 800,000 ha it protects but because of the wildlife living within it. The park is known for its large animals, such as the cheetah, buffalo, and aardvark. Most notably, W National Park is home to the most extensive grouping of the endangered West African Elephants.                                                              In 2016, the African elephant Status Report estimated that 6,850 elephants live in Burkina Faso. In 2003, the government of Burkina Faso at the time published an elephant management strategy that successfully increased the dying elephant population. Unfortunately, as the political situation degraded in Burkina Faso, so did the protection of these elephants. As a result, poaching carcasses have increased to about 50 - 86 per year.                                                              By actively establishing, protecting, and maintaining National Parks, we can continue to hope to see an increase in Africa’s biodiversity. However, we cannot rely on National Parks alone to protect our planet. It will take a considerable effort from everyone to keep temperatures low, keep species alive, and continue the harmony of the ecosystem. Through FarmSahel’s programs and the continued efforts of smallholder farmers implementing sustainable permaculture, FarmSahel will be able to revitalize and maintain the beautiful ecosystem of Africa.                                                              https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/SSC-OP-060_E.pdf                               https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-four-national-parks-of-burkina-faso.html                               https://discover-burkinafaso.com/national-parks/                               https://www.africatouroperators.org/burkina-faso/kabore-tambi-national-park                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deux_Bal%C3%A9s_National_Park                               https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/africa/mare-aux-hippopotames                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_National_Park                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_Burkina_Faso#W_of_the_Niger_National_Park",

        "Description": "While FarmSahel focuses on improving agriculture, Africa is also a continent rich in raw minerals. Mining has been a prime export of Africa starting around 1000 BCE in Northern Central Africa, where the Early Iron Age originated on the continent. Before the scramble for Africa by European nations, explorers saw the multitude of mines for precious metals from gold to copper. Unfortunately, not every African civilization had access to the income that luxurious metals brought. Even in 2022, Africa is still a major source of minerals that spread around the globe. Unfortunately, even now, people are being exploited to extract those minerals.                                             Commonly referred to as 3T minerals: tin, tantalum, and tungsten. The 3T minerals are essential to creating standard technology. They are relied on by major companies such as Apple, Tesla, Intel, and Microsoft. As the technology boom flourished and a focus on better batteries and smaller components came to fruition, so did the question of ethical sourcing. In 2009, a group of organizations created the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative or the ITSCI. It aims to create a reliable and ethical supply chain for the 3T minerals. Through a system of government validation of mines, audits, and specialty tagging, companies and countries would be able to know that these minerals came from ethical mines. Most mines for the 3T minerals come from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. It is also from these two countries that most conflict minerals are making it to market.                                                                    A conflict mineral comes from a mine that is exploiting its workers. Usually, this means an armed militia group has taken control of the mine where they can use child labor, force nearby towns to work, and ignore any safety precautions. These mines are a vital source of income for these militia groups. With the ability to launder minerals into the overall market, violence has raged for control of the mines. Militia groups are vying for more mines to increase their income, with no accountability for smuggling minerals onto the international stage.                                                                    In 2014, the ITSCI government first recognized the contamination of conflict minerals in the international market. Then, in 2015, the Congolese NGO Max Impact also alleged that conflict minerals were making it past the ITSCI verification and into the market. Now, decades later, Global Witness has evidence that only 20% of the 83 tons of 3T minerals have come from validated mines. Most of the contamination comes from the east of the DRC near the border with Rwanda. In addition, Global Witness and other NGOs continuously find that mines are tagging much more minerals than they have produced.                                                                    Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a solution in sight. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development determined that the ITSCI verification system aligns with its due diligence despite continued evidence from NGOs and Watchdog groups. In addition, Global Witness found new evidence suggesting that ITSCI individuals frequently downplay or ignore incidents of contamination that seriously affect the supply chain. Furthermore, according to the UN, highly underpaid governmental employees often participate in smuggling. With minimal field staff and an extreme lack of oversight from the ITSCI, it is difficult to see a clear solution.                                                                    Global Witness listed a list of potential reforms that can get conflict minerals out of the international supply. Unfortunately, major companies are contempt at trusting the mechanism in place, which has proven to fail. Reforming the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative is a necessary first step to avoiding conflicts of interest. Second, Global Witness calls for validated mines to be transparent in their mineral production data.                                                                     We must rely on the action of NGOs and groups like Global Witness to continue to bring this lawlessness to light. Mining is already a life-threatening job, but we rely on the precious minerals in our everyday lives. It is not impossible to have a world where companies can trace all minerals back to an ethically sourced mine!                                                                     https://news.mongabay.com/2022/05/scheme-to-stop-conflict-minerals-fails-to-end-child-labor-in-drc-report-says/                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/natural-resource-governance/itsci-laundromat/#key-recommendations                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/20347/The_ITSCI_Laundromat_-_April_2022.pdf                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/conflict-minerals/#:~:text=The%20global%20minerals%20trade%20has,supply%20chains%20and%20mitigating%20harms.",

        "Description": "In December 2015, the 21st Conference of Parties was held in Paris, where 196 countries signed the Paris Climate Agreement. In short, this agreement brings most nations together to develop and implement ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, many climate activities do not believe the agreement goes far enough. First, each country must act on its own accord and set its greenhouse gas targets. Second, the plans that were introduced in 2015 were not aggressive enough to combat the 1.5 degrees Celsius the Paris Climate Agreement is trying to avoid. Third, after almost six years of the Paris Climate Agreement, we have seen that countries are not taking the extreme measures needed to limit emissions.                                                                   While the Paris agreement may not have been the answer to the most pressing issue humanity faces, COP21 produced another lesser-known initiative. The 4 per 1000 initiative was launched by France in December 2015 aimed as a grassroots effort to show the importance agricultural soils have in reducing climate change and increasing food security. The 4 per 1000 initiative is strictly voluntary, but, unlike the Paris agreement, it targets everybody from states, companies, NGOs, and non-profit organizations to implement actions for soil carbon storage.                                                                          The 4 per 1000 initiative focuses on the benefits of soil carbon storage that turn greenhouse gas emissions from plants into nutrients for the soil. Its name comes from the target increase to significantly improve soil vitality. Scientific research shows that an annual 0.4% increase in soil carbon retention will significantly reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Currently, the world’s soil stock is storing 1,500 billion tons of carbon in the form of organic matter. Soil is able to store carbon dioxide from plants that have pulled the greenhouse gas in through photosynthesis. When the plant dies, organic matter from the soil breaks down the plant, storing the CO2, and creating a more nutritious and healthier soil layer.                                                                          While 1,500 billion tons of CO2 sounds like a lot, it does not compete in scale of the 36.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from human activities in 2019. Each year, that amount increases by 4.3 billion tons. A rate that is hard to slow down and almost impossible to capture. Additionally, soil degradation is increasing while the weather turns extreme to heat waves and floods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that 75% of soils are already degraded in varying degrees due to human activities.                                                                          In this dire situation, the 4 per 1000 initiative gives everybody the opportunity to work towards reducing climate change. 4 per 1000 focuses on increasing the ability of soil to store carbon, which will increase the soil’s health. The initiative lists ways farmers worldwide can better protect and support their soil:                                                                          • Never leave soil bare.                                     • Use no-tilling methods of farming.                                     • Grow more cover crops.                                     • Develop agroforestry.                                     • Optimize pasture management.                                     • Improve water and fertilizer management.                                                                          The 4 per 1000 initiative lists these as ways to start enriching and protecting our soils from further damage. Not only storing greenhouse gasses but increasing food security through healthier soil.                                     FarmSahel has already implemented most of these recommendations in Burkina Faso. However, we have the added task of having to restore soil vitality before protecting its nutrients. FarmSahel will continue to implement these recommendations to restore soil nutrients, and we hope with our commitment to the 4per1000 initiative, we can continue to highlight the importance of sustainable permaculture.                                      FarmSahel has joined this grassroots effort to show the world how vital soil health is. Nutritious soil will benefit the climate, biodiversity, farmers, and families.

Africa’s vast and diverse wilderness is breathtaking but disappearing, and her population is growing but unstable. Yet, through all the hardships faced on the continent, the everyday people of Africa have shown their resilience and ability to keep looking forward, not giving up no matter the difficulties they face.

        "Description": "Evolutionary history constantly changes as scientists find new fossil records and archeologists reinterpret old evidence. Although, what has remained true is modern humans’ first continent, Africa. It is here that the entire world as we know it started. Ninety thousand years ago, the first people migrated out of Africa to explore a new world and create new cultures, languages, and technologies. One of these developments was one that completely changed the way humans lived, domestication.                                                                         As hunter-gatherers, humans migrated alongside their food. They had no permanent settlements, and everyone worked together to feed their small tribe. Eventually, agriculture started to seep into the lives of people. The exact time and way ancient humans first domesticated plants and animals is still not known. Archaeologists believed that once a tribe learned about agriculture, they switched entirely and that this way of life spread worldwide, hence the name agricultural revolution. However, recently this theory has been disproven. Some tribes in Africa kept to their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, while others took a hybrid approach. Archeological records also indicate that humans discovered agriculture around the late stone age when people carved stones into specific shapes for weapons and tools.                                                              Another misconception many people have is that the discovery of agricultural production happened in one place. In reality, cultures worldwide discovered domestication in multiple places, but the exact process of how it came about will never be known. However, archeologists and historians have a consensus on the most likely way plant and animal domestication was discovered.                                                              It is believed that the gatherers of the tribe started to protect certain crops, mostly cereals like sorghum and millets. People would protect the crops by weeding and resowing their seeds. Gatherers soon found that resowing healthier crops produced better crops the following year. True domestication came when a family of crops became dependent on human intervention. As the years went by, the plant would no longer be able to compete with weeds but would produce a much higher yield.                                                              The same process took place with the domestication of wild animals. Again, the members of the tribe would protect the healthier wild animals. The animals would be herded together and brought to better grazing sites to increase their size. Larger animals produced more milk and meat, but the animals now required human assistance to survive. The agricultural revolution was long and drawn out, but its impacts changed humans’ entire understanding of the world!                                                              People around the world and in Africa started settling. Instead of makeshift shelters, people began to use mud, thatch, and even stones to create permanent housing. With the rise of agriculture, people began to develop better tools, use them, and be able to store them. They were no longer restricted to only taking what they could carry on their backs. Even more importantly, as people began settling in fertile regions and having a reliable food source, they had more children. Once seen as a burden to carry and care for, the entire family helped raise newborn babies. They would soon be in the fields helping their family with the harvest. Families also gained access to a surplus. If families were able to produce more than they could consume, they would have food security through bad harvests or severe weather. They would also be able to trade with artisans for other goods.                                                              Agriculture completely changed the way human beings interacted with their environment. They no longer lived in harmony with nature, migrating with the weather and animals. This surplus quickly started to create classes between rich and poor. However, this change was much more gradual than recently believed. Many early farming communities still relied heavily on hunting. Some communities simply domesticated animals, migrating to the best feeding spots every season. Archaeologists believe that most of Africa’s traditional religions gained a spiritual element during the agricultural revolution. People now had to rely on the weather and the varying climate. This brought about prayers for rain, fertility, and a good harvest.                                                              Plant and animal domestication was a long and slow process but soon took over every corner of the world. It became embedded in ancient people’s lifestyles and religions. The agricultural revolution was a significant turning point in the history of homo sapiens. We still rely heavily on farm production, and FarmSahel is working to ensure farmers can produce crops for generations.

        "Description": "On August 5th, Burkina Faso celebrated its 62nd Independence Day! Colonial rule was brutal to the African people, and it decimated cultures. Luckily, the people of Burkina Faso stood tall against French rule and are still able to practice those ancient traditions that their ancestors participated in generations ago.                                                                         It wasn’t until Thomas Sankara took power in 1983 in a bloodless coup when The Republic of Upper Volta officially became Burkina Faso. Sankara chose the name Burkina Faso from two of the country’s most common languages. As an attempt to drive away corruption and gain greater autonomy from foreign influence, the name roughly translates to ‘Land of Honest People.’ Unfortunately, the political situation of Burkina Faso has not improved with continued coups, violence, and poverty. However, the Burkinabe people have never waivered and continue practicing their traditional culture, especially in rural areas.                                                              While French is the official language of Burkina Faso, there are over 70 languages throughout the country, 60 of which are indigenous to the region. Each of these languages has its own myths, spiritual traditions, and cultures which survived the onslaught of western colonization. Overall, the traditional beliefs of many indigenous cultures differ from western cultures. Burkina Faso’s traditional ideas focus on an inter-dependence between communities and living in harmony with nature. Traditional culture focuses on living well, not living better, which helps deter conflict between ethnic groups.                                                              With such deep roots in traditional culture, Burkina Faso is rich in music, clothing, and rituals. Traditional music often consisted of drums, flutes, and stringed instruments. In addition, in the west of the country, an instrument called the balophon is made with dried gourds. Dancers usually accompany music in colorful costumes. Music is such an important aspect of traditional culture that Burkina Faso holds a biennial festival called the International Festival of Masks and the Arts or FESTIMA.                                                              The International Festival of Masks and the Arts started in 1996 and occurs every other year, falling on even years. The fifteenth festival took place in early March 2020 and lasted several days. The festival is held in Burkina Faso, the most recent in Bankuy. Thousands of people come to see dancers in traditional clothes and masks perform ancient rituals from west African countries. There is usually a translator at the festival to help interpret the dance being performed. While music and dance are integral to the traditional culture of Burkina Faso, this festival focuses on the protection of Masks that are very important to the Mossi ethnic group.                                                              The Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso, accounting for about 52% of the population. The ancient Mossi empire controlled a large portion of the center of Upper Volta. The Nyonyose, farmers and spiritual segments of ancient Mossi culture, used masks in rituals and religious observances. Archaeologists found that the Mossi primarily used masks at burials, especially for leading elders and chiefs. Rituals would be performed continuously after an elder had died since elders had the most respect in the Mossi hierarchical system. It is believed that Masks allowed the spirit to pass into the world of ancestors. It is believed without a proper funeral the spirit would cause trouble for their descendants. Thick, vibrant costumes accompanied masks. Masks are still sacred in many traditional parts of Burkina Faso and are seen as a link to spirits and nature.                                                              These traditional parts of Burkina Faso are usually rural regions. They have relied on oral tradition to pass down poems, folk tales, songs, and more. It wasn’t until late into colonization that written literature came to the Burkinabe people, some of whom started to write down oral stories, mostly from the Mossi ethnic group.                                                              While cultural tradition and language have survived colonial rule, new problems are bringing Burkina Faso’s rich culture into demise. Most notably, young people are flocking to cities to find higher-paying jobs. These cities do not follow the traditional culture and are much more westernized. Second, the noble aspects of traditional Burkina Faso culture are disappearing as life becomes more difficult for the rural population. Third, climate change, internally displaced people, and terrorism forced some groups to have forgotten about living well and in harmony with nature.                                                              FarmSahel hopes to continue or bring back that ancient tradition of living in harmony with nature. Our programs are designed to help mitigate the effect of climate change, allow villages to better absorb the impact of migrants, and bring harmony back between the agriculturalists and their land.                                                                                                                            https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2016/3/13/in-burkina-faso-festima-a-festival-of-african-masks                               https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/burkina-faso/history-and-culture                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossi_people#:~:text=The%20Mossi)%20are%20a%20Gur,or%20about%2011.1%20million%20people.                               https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-culture-of-burkina-faso.html                               https://barkafoundation.org/burkina-faso-history-culture-climate-people-more/",

        "Description": "Around the world, National parks are protecting sea creatures, insects, and fauna alike. In Burkina Faso, five national parks preserve the beauty of West African wildlife. One of the oldest National parks in Burkina Faso is called the Mare aux Hippopotames.                                                                         Established in 1937, the Mare aux Hippopotames became the only UNESCO Biosphere reserve in the nation. Formally established in 1977 and translated to ‘Lake of Hippopotamuses,’ it was created around a freshwater lake with other pools and marshes. It spans about 19,200 ha covering the floodplain of the black volta river. While the park’s main feature is the lake it is named after, the surrounding and protected galley forests have the most beneficial impact on the larger ecosystem. Galley forests form corridors along waterways, growing trees in regions that do not typically support tree growth. In these galley forests, Elephants, antelopes, primates, and hundreds of bird species can roam free. In addition, in the freshwater lake, crocodiles and a large population of hippopotamuses bring tourists to the region. Located in the southwest of Burkina Faso, the wildlife of Mare aux Hippopotames sees only four months of rainy weather, making the protection of the freshwater lake vital to the ecosystem.                                                              Moving east in Burkina Faso, located just north of the border of Ghana, is the second National Park of Burkina Faso, Kaborè Tambi National Park. Founded in 1976, the park follows the Nazinon river covering 155,500 ha. The large stretch of land has become a safe haven for wildlife, particularly birds, in Burkina Faso. But unfortunately, the park is not immune to poachers. In 1991, a ranger lost his life to poachers, and the park was renamed in his honor.                                                              Poachers have been a major issue throughout Africa since the discovery of ivory. Focusing on elephants, poachers are debilitating the population. The Deux Balès National Park was once home to the largest population of elephants in Burkina Faso in 2001. In 1937, as part of French West Africa, the area was named the Deux Balès Classified Forests. Unfortunately, the name is misleading, for this area was never designated as a national park. The area of the park ranges anywhere from 61,000 ha to 81,000 ha. While it is no longer home to a large population of elephants, the park is home to various flora. Most notably aging baobab trees. Native to Africa, baobab trees are widespread and can live up to 2,000 years. While this park is a haven for vegetation, without proper management, protection, and designation as a national park, wildlife continues to be threatened.                                                              The last set of national parks is a joint effort by multiple countries in West Africa. The first, Arli National Park, is located on the far east side of Burkina Faso, linking up with Benin’s Pendjari National Park. The Arli National Park holds a portion of the habitat home to Burkina Faso’s elephant population. The park is also home to hippopotamuses, lions, woodlands, gallery forests, and sandstone hills.                                                              Just north of Arli is W National Park, a major national park in West Africa encompassing three countries: Burkina Faso, Niger, and Bennin. Formally established in 1954, the park follows a bend of the River Niger that outlines a ‘W’ where the park gets its name. While the area is largely uninhabited due to wetlands that create a malaria zone, archaeological discoveries have shown humans once occupied the area. W National Park is significant not only for the 800,000 ha it protects but because of the wildlife living within it. The park is known for its large animals, such as the cheetah, buffalo, and aardvark. Most notably, W National Park is home to the most extensive grouping of the endangered West African Elephants.                                                              In 2016, the African elephant Status Report estimated that 6,850 elephants live in Burkina Faso. In 2003, the government of Burkina Faso at the time published an elephant management strategy that successfully increased the dying elephant population. Unfortunately, as the political situation degraded in Burkina Faso, so did the protection of these elephants. As a result, poaching carcasses have increased to about 50 - 86 per year.                                                              By actively establishing, protecting, and maintaining National Parks, we can continue to hope to see an increase in Africa’s biodiversity. However, we cannot rely on National Parks alone to protect our planet. It will take a considerable effort from everyone to keep temperatures low, keep species alive, and continue the harmony of the ecosystem. Through FarmSahel’s programs and the continued efforts of smallholder farmers implementing sustainable permaculture, FarmSahel will be able to revitalize and maintain the beautiful ecosystem of Africa.                                                              https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/SSC-OP-060_E.pdf                               https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-four-national-parks-of-burkina-faso.html                               https://discover-burkinafaso.com/national-parks/                               https://www.africatouroperators.org/burkina-faso/kabore-tambi-national-park                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deux_Bal%C3%A9s_National_Park                               https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/africa/mare-aux-hippopotames                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_National_Park                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_Burkina_Faso#W_of_the_Niger_National_Park",

        "Description": "While FarmSahel focuses on improving agriculture, Africa is also a continent rich in raw minerals. Mining has been a prime export of Africa starting around 1000 BCE in Northern Central Africa, where the Early Iron Age originated on the continent. Before the scramble for Africa by European nations, explorers saw the multitude of mines for precious metals from gold to copper. Unfortunately, not every African civilization had access to the income that luxurious metals brought. Even in 2022, Africa is still a major source of minerals that spread around the globe. Unfortunately, even now, people are being exploited to extract those minerals.                                             Commonly referred to as 3T minerals: tin, tantalum, and tungsten. The 3T minerals are essential to creating standard technology. They are relied on by major companies such as Apple, Tesla, Intel, and Microsoft. As the technology boom flourished and a focus on better batteries and smaller components came to fruition, so did the question of ethical sourcing. In 2009, a group of organizations created the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative or the ITSCI. It aims to create a reliable and ethical supply chain for the 3T minerals. Through a system of government validation of mines, audits, and specialty tagging, companies and countries would be able to know that these minerals came from ethical mines. Most mines for the 3T minerals come from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. It is also from these two countries that most conflict minerals are making it to market.                                                                    A conflict mineral comes from a mine that is exploiting its workers. Usually, this means an armed militia group has taken control of the mine where they can use child labor, force nearby towns to work, and ignore any safety precautions. These mines are a vital source of income for these militia groups. With the ability to launder minerals into the overall market, violence has raged for control of the mines. Militia groups are vying for more mines to increase their income, with no accountability for smuggling minerals onto the international stage.                                                                    In 2014, the ITSCI government first recognized the contamination of conflict minerals in the international market. Then, in 2015, the Congolese NGO Max Impact also alleged that conflict minerals were making it past the ITSCI verification and into the market. Now, decades later, Global Witness has evidence that only 20% of the 83 tons of 3T minerals have come from validated mines. Most of the contamination comes from the east of the DRC near the border with Rwanda. In addition, Global Witness and other NGOs continuously find that mines are tagging much more minerals than they have produced.                                                                    Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a solution in sight. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development determined that the ITSCI verification system aligns with its due diligence despite continued evidence from NGOs and Watchdog groups. In addition, Global Witness found new evidence suggesting that ITSCI individuals frequently downplay or ignore incidents of contamination that seriously affect the supply chain. Furthermore, according to the UN, highly underpaid governmental employees often participate in smuggling. With minimal field staff and an extreme lack of oversight from the ITSCI, it is difficult to see a clear solution.                                                                    Global Witness listed a list of potential reforms that can get conflict minerals out of the international supply. Unfortunately, major companies are contempt at trusting the mechanism in place, which has proven to fail. Reforming the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative is a necessary first step to avoiding conflicts of interest. Second, Global Witness calls for validated mines to be transparent in their mineral production data.                                                                     We must rely on the action of NGOs and groups like Global Witness to continue to bring this lawlessness to light. Mining is already a life-threatening job, but we rely on the precious minerals in our everyday lives. It is not impossible to have a world where companies can trace all minerals back to an ethically sourced mine!                                                                     https://news.mongabay.com/2022/05/scheme-to-stop-conflict-minerals-fails-to-end-child-labor-in-drc-report-says/                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/natural-resource-governance/itsci-laundromat/#key-recommendations                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/20347/The_ITSCI_Laundromat_-_April_2022.pdf                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/conflict-minerals/#:~:text=The%20global%20minerals%20trade%20has,supply%20chains%20and%20mitigating%20harms.",

As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters. ClimSA is another tool that will be life-saving to farmers and rural Burkinabe people who may be in a storm's path. But, unfortunately, developed countries need to do more not only to finance but to transition into a zero-carbon economy.  \n  \n  \n https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries \n  \n https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2022/11/09/cop27-burkina-faso-uses-improved-methods-to-predict-rainfall-and-extreme-weather-events_6003529_124.html \n  \n https://www.carbonbrief.org/west-africas-deadly-rainfall-in-2022-made-80-times-more-likely-by-climate-change/"

        "Description": "In December 2015, the 21st Conference of Parties was held in Paris, where 196 countries signed the Paris Climate Agreement. In short, this agreement brings most nations together to develop and implement ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, many climate activities do not believe the agreement goes far enough. First, each country must act on its own accord and set its greenhouse gas targets. Second, the plans that were introduced in 2015 were not aggressive enough to combat the 1.5 degrees Celsius the Paris Climate Agreement is trying to avoid. Third, after almost six years of the Paris Climate Agreement, we have seen that countries are not taking the extreme measures needed to limit emissions.                                                                   While the Paris agreement may not have been the answer to the most pressing issue humanity faces, COP21 produced another lesser-known initiative. The 4 per 1000 initiative was launched by France in December 2015 aimed as a grassroots effort to show the importance agricultural soils have in reducing climate change and increasing food security. The 4 per 1000 initiative is strictly voluntary, but, unlike the Paris agreement, it targets everybody from states, companies, NGOs, and non-profit organizations to implement actions for soil carbon storage.                                                                          The 4 per 1000 initiative focuses on the benefits of soil carbon storage that turn greenhouse gas emissions from plants into nutrients for the soil. Its name comes from the target increase to significantly improve soil vitality. Scientific research shows that an annual 0.4% increase in soil carbon retention will significantly reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Currently, the world’s soil stock is storing 1,500 billion tons of carbon in the form of organic matter. Soil is able to store carbon dioxide from plants that have pulled the greenhouse gas in through photosynthesis. When the plant dies, organic matter from the soil breaks down the plant, storing the CO2, and creating a more nutritious and healthier soil layer.                                                                          While 1,500 billion tons of CO2 sounds like a lot, it does not compete in scale of the 36.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from human activities in 2019. Each year, that amount increases by 4.3 billion tons. A rate that is hard to slow down and almost impossible to capture. Additionally, soil degradation is increasing while the weather turns extreme to heat waves and floods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that 75% of soils are already degraded in varying degrees due to human activities.                                                                          In this dire situation, the 4 per 1000 initiative gives everybody the opportunity to work towards reducing climate change. 4 per 1000 focuses on increasing the ability of soil to store carbon, which will increase the soil’s health. The initiative lists ways farmers worldwide can better protect and support their soil:                                                                          • Never leave soil bare.                                     • Use no-tilling methods of farming.                                     • Grow more cover crops.                                     • Develop agroforestry.                                     • Optimize pasture management.                                     • Improve water and fertilizer management.                                                                          The 4 per 1000 initiative lists these as ways to start enriching and protecting our soils from further damage. Not only storing greenhouse gasses but increasing food security through healthier soil.                                     FarmSahel has already implemented most of these recommendations in Burkina Faso. However, we have the added task of having to restore soil vitality before protecting its nutrients. FarmSahel will continue to implement these recommendations to restore soil nutrients, and we hope with our commitment to the 4per1000 initiative, we can continue to highlight the importance of sustainable permaculture.                                      FarmSahel has joined this grassroots effort to show the world how vital soil health is. Nutritious soil will benefit the climate, biodiversity, farmers, and families. FarmSahel has programs in place to start bringing life back to the soils of Burkina Faso. Only through donations can we continue our effort to promote and implement sustainable permaculture.                                                                                                               https://4p1000.org/discover/?lang=en                                                                          https://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/12/world/global-climate-change-conference-vote/                                                                          https://regenerationinternational.org/4p1000/                                                                          https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement",

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters.

Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters. ClimSA is another tool that will be life-saving to farmers and rural Burkinabe people who may be in a storm's path. But, unfortunately, developed countries need to do more not only to finance but to transition into a zero-carbon economy.  \n  \n  \n https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries \n  \n https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2022/11/09/cop27-burkina-faso-uses-improved-methods-to-predict-rainfall-and-extreme-weather-events_6003529_124.html \n  \n https://www.carbonbrief.org/west-africas-deadly-rainfall-in-2022-made-80-times-more-likely-by-climate-change/"

From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine.

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters.

From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28.

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues.

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters.

With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters. ClimSA is another tool that will be life-saving to farmers and rural Burkinabe people who may be in a storm's path. But, unfortunately, developed countries need to do more not only to finance but to transition into a zero-carbon economy.  \n  \n  \n https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries \n  \n https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2022/11/09/cop27-burkina-faso-uses-improved-methods-to-predict-rainfall-and-extreme-weather-events_6003529_124.html \n  \n https://www.carbonbrief.org/west-africas-deadly-rainfall-in-2022-made-80-times-more-likely-by-climate-change/"

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues.

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters. ClimSA is another tool that will be life-saving to farmers and rural Burkinabe people who may be in a storm's path.

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues.

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters.

With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year.

From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland.

        "Text": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.  \n  \n  Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.  \n  \n  Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.  \n  \n  Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public. In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.  \n  \n The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours. As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.  \n  \n For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.  \n  \n The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters.

She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

        "Description": "In late 2022 Burkina Faso was one of the western Sahel countries to receive an onslaught of heavy and unpredictable rain. From June to October of 2022, over 800 people died, and flooding destroyed millions of hectares of farmland. Human-caused climate change made the 2022 wet season 20% more severe, exacerbating the chronic food security crisis facing Burkina Faso and the Sahel. Crops in most of the Western Sahel received 40% less water than needed. As a result, in Burkina Faso, crop production dropped by 10% compared to the previous five-year average.                                                                                                 Food prices rose significantly due to a low harvest and a lack of imports hampered by the war in Ukraine. Experts wanted to find a link between the 2021 drought and the 2022 deadly rainfall in the Sahel. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect trends or plan preventative measures due to a lack of weather instruments.                                                               Now Burkina Faso is modernizing its technology to track and predict the weather as the onslaught of climate change continues. The European Union funded a pilot program called ClimSA which started in Burkina Faso and is now moving to 17 other West African countries. This program allows countries like Burkina Faso to better predict and track weather. Over 300 stations across Burkina Faso take measurements of temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation levels, and atmospheric pressure. With this information, trained Burkinabe meteorologists can refine forecasts and monitor the impact of climate change.                                                               Weather stations and weather prediction systems were severely lacking across the entire continent of Africa. From 1990 to 2019, Africa received only 3.5% of global funding for climate research. Now, with the ClimSA program, meteorologists are able to communicate better with the general public.                       In Burkina Faso, agricultural bulletins are sent to local radio stations in eight different languages with specialized weather reports. With over 900,000 daily listeners, farmers are taking advantage of the new information. They are able to know when to plant and listen to seasonal weather forecasts. The meteorologists also use the large radio audience to explain to farmers how to improve yields, manage water, and refresh degraded soil.                                                                                                The information collected has shown that there has been a steady increase in temperatures in Burkina Faso over the years. Rainfall is coming late in the season and only as heavy and destructive downpours.                       As meteorologists were setting up the new advanced weather systems across Burkina Faso, in Egypt, a breakthrough was made at COP27. The United Nations Climate Change conference provided an agreement called \"\"loss and damage,\"\" which plans to fund vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The governments involved in creating the agreement will establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on funding arrangements at COP28. This committee's first meeting will be in March of 2023.                                                                                                For the globe to transition into a low-carbon economy, it is estimated to cost between $4 to $6 trillion a year. Activists continue to worry about the promise of change, but the lack of action as developed countries have not yet met the $100 billion per year by 2020 as promised.                                                              The new loss and damage fund will help countries like Burkina Faso continue to mitigate climate change disasters. ClimSA is another tool that will be life-saving to farmers and rural Burkinabe people who may be in a storm's path. But, unfortunately, developed countries need to do more not only to finance but to transition into a zero-carbon economy.                                                                                             https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries                                                              https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2022/11/09/cop27-burkina-faso-uses-improved-methods-to-predict-rainfall-and-extreme-weather-events_6003529_124.html                                                              https://www.carbonbrief.org/west-africas-deadly-rainfall-in-2022-made-80-times-more-likely-by-climate-change/",

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month. These cases are reported to local authorities, and victims receive adequate medical care.</span> \n</span></p><p><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p></div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-6 medium-6 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1858156281\"\"> <div class=\"\"u_1577670191 imageWidget align-center\"\" data-element-type=\"\"image\"\" data-widget-type=\"\"image\"\" id=\"\"1577670191\"\" editablewidget=\"\"true\"\"><img src=\"\"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_8342-1920w.JPG\"\" alt=\"\"\"\" id=\"\"1427465577\"\" class=\"\"\"\" data-dm-image-path=\"\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/IMG_8342.JPG\"\" width=\"\"1284\"\" height=\"\"1500\"\" onerror=\"\"handleImageLoadError(this)\"\"></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1678401970\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1179073440\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 medium-12 large-12\"\" id=\"\"1909603167\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1143167176\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1143167176\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Kinda is a shining example of the resilience and hope the Burkinabe people carry with them no matter their hardships.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month. These cases are reported to local authorities, and victims receive adequate medical care.</span> \n</span></p><p><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p></div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-6 medium-6 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1858156281\"\"> <div class=\"\"u_1577670191 imageWidget align-center\"\" data-element-type=\"\"image\"\" data-widget-type=\"\"image\"\" id=\"\"1577670191\"\" editablewidget=\"\"true\"\"><img src=\"\"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_8342-1920w.JPG\"\" alt=\"\"\"\" id=\"\"1427465577\"\" class=\"\"\"\" data-dm-image-path=\"\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/IMG_8342.JPG\"\" width=\"\"1284\"\" height=\"\"1500\"\" onerror=\"\"handleImageLoadError(this)\"\"></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1678401970\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1179073440\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 medium-12 large-12\"\" id=\"\"1909603167\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1143167176\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1143167176\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Kinda is a shining example of the resilience and hope the Burkinabe people carry with them no matter their hardships.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

        "Description": "Evolutionary history constantly changes as scientists find new fossil records and archeologists reinterpret old evidence. Although, what has remained true is modern humans’ first continent, Africa. It is here that the entire world as we know it started. Ninety thousand years ago, the first people migrated out of Africa to explore a new world and create new cultures, languages, and technologies. One of these developments was one that completely changed the way humans lived, domestication.                                                                         As hunter-gatherers, humans migrated alongside their food. They had no permanent settlements, and everyone worked together to feed their small tribe. Eventually, agriculture started to seep into the lives of people. The exact time and way ancient humans first domesticated plants and animals is still not known. Archaeologists believed that once a tribe learned about agriculture, they switched entirely and that this way of life spread worldwide, hence the name agricultural revolution. However, recently this theory has been disproven. Some tribes in Africa kept to their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, while others took a hybrid approach. Archeological records also indicate that humans discovered agriculture around the late stone age when people carved stones into specific shapes for weapons and tools.                                                              Another misconception many people have is that the discovery of agricultural production happened in one place. In reality, cultures worldwide discovered domestication in multiple places, but the exact process of how it came about will never be known. However, archeologists and historians have a consensus on the most likely way plant and animal domestication was discovered.                                                              It is believed that the gatherers of the tribe started to protect certain crops, mostly cereals like sorghum and millets. People would protect the crops by weeding and resowing their seeds. Gatherers soon found that resowing healthier crops produced better crops the following year. True domestication came when a family of crops became dependent on human intervention. As the years went by, the plant would no longer be able to compete with weeds but would produce a much higher yield.                                                              The same process took place with the domestication of wild animals. Again, the members of the tribe would protect the healthier wild animals. The animals would be herded together and brought to better grazing sites to increase their size. Larger animals produced more milk and meat, but the animals now required human assistance to survive. The agricultural revolution was long and drawn out, but its impacts changed humans’ entire understanding of the world!                                                              People around the world and in Africa started settling. Instead of makeshift shelters, people began to use mud, thatch, and even stones to create permanent housing. With the rise of agriculture, people began to develop better tools, use them, and be able to store them. They were no longer restricted to only taking what they could carry on their backs. Even more importantly, as people began settling in fertile regions and having a reliable food source, they had more children. Once seen as a burden to carry and care for, the entire family helped raise newborn babies. They would soon be in the fields helping their family with the harvest. Families also gained access to a surplus. If families were able to produce more than they could consume, they would have food security through bad harvests or severe weather. They would also be able to trade with artisans for other goods.                                                              Agriculture completely changed the way human beings interacted with their environment. They no longer lived in harmony with nature, migrating with the weather and animals. This surplus quickly started to create classes between rich and poor. However, this change was much more gradual than recently believed. Many early farming communities still relied heavily on hunting. Some communities simply domesticated animals, migrating to the best feeding spots every season. Archaeologists believe that most of Africa’s traditional religions gained a spiritual element during the agricultural revolution. People now had to rely on the weather and the varying climate. This brought about prayers for rain, fertility, and a good harvest.                                                              Plant and animal domestication was a long and slow process but soon took over every corner of the world. It became embedded in ancient people’s lifestyles and religions. The agricultural revolution was a significant turning point in the history of homo sapiens. We still rely heavily on farm production, and FarmSahel is working to ensure farmers can produce crops for generations.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month. These cases are reported to local authorities, and victims receive adequate medical care.</span> \n</span></p><p><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p></div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-6 medium-6 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1858156281\"\"> <div class=\"\"u_1577670191 imageWidget align-center\"\" data-element-type=\"\"image\"\" data-widget-type=\"\"image\"\" id=\"\"1577670191\"\" editablewidget=\"\"true\"\"><img src=\"\"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_8342-1920w.JPG\"\" alt=\"\"\"\" id=\"\"1427465577\"\" class=\"\"\"\" data-dm-image-path=\"\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/IMG_8342.JPG\"\" width=\"\"1284\"\" height=\"\"1500\"\" onerror=\"\"handleImageLoadError(this)\"\"></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1678401970\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1179073440\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 medium-12 large-12\"\" id=\"\"1909603167\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1143167176\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1143167176\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Kinda is a shining example of the resilience and hope the Burkinabe people carry with them no matter their hardships.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

        "Description": "On August 5th, Burkina Faso celebrated its 62nd Independence Day! Colonial rule was brutal to the African people, and it decimated cultures. Luckily, the people of Burkina Faso stood tall against French rule and are still able to practice those ancient traditions that their ancestors participated in generations ago.                                                                         It wasn’t until Thomas Sankara took power in 1983 in a bloodless coup when The Republic of Upper Volta officially became Burkina Faso. Sankara chose the name Burkina Faso from two of the country’s most common languages. As an attempt to drive away corruption and gain greater autonomy from foreign influence, the name roughly translates to ‘Land of Honest People.’ Unfortunately, the political situation of Burkina Faso has not improved with continued coups, violence, and poverty. However, the Burkinabe people have never waivered and continue practicing their traditional culture, especially in rural areas.                                                              While French is the official language of Burkina Faso, there are over 70 languages throughout the country, 60 of which are indigenous to the region. Each of these languages has its own myths, spiritual traditions, and cultures which survived the onslaught of western colonization. Overall, the traditional beliefs of many indigenous cultures differ from western cultures. Burkina Faso’s traditional ideas focus on an inter-dependence between communities and living in harmony with nature. Traditional culture focuses on living well, not living better, which helps deter conflict between ethnic groups.                                                              With such deep roots in traditional culture, Burkina Faso is rich in music, clothing, and rituals. Traditional music often consisted of drums, flutes, and stringed instruments. In addition, in the west of the country, an instrument called the balophon is made with dried gourds. Dancers usually accompany music in colorful costumes. Music is such an important aspect of traditional culture that Burkina Faso holds a biennial festival called the International Festival of Masks and the Arts or FESTIMA.                                                              The International Festival of Masks and the Arts started in 1996 and occurs every other year, falling on even years. The fifteenth festival took place in early March 2020 and lasted several days. The festival is held in Burkina Faso, the most recent in Bankuy. Thousands of people come to see dancers in traditional clothes and masks perform ancient rituals from west African countries. There is usually a translator at the festival to help interpret the dance being performed. While music and dance are integral to the traditional culture of Burkina Faso, this festival focuses on the protection of Masks that are very important to the Mossi ethnic group.                                                              The Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso, accounting for about 52% of the population. The ancient Mossi empire controlled a large portion of the center of Upper Volta. The Nyonyose, farmers and spiritual segments of ancient Mossi culture, used masks in rituals and religious observances. Archaeologists found that the Mossi primarily used masks at burials, especially for leading elders and chiefs. Rituals would be performed continuously after an elder had died since elders had the most respect in the Mossi hierarchical system. It is believed that Masks allowed the spirit to pass into the world of ancestors. It is believed without a proper funeral the spirit would cause trouble for their descendants. Thick, vibrant costumes accompanied masks. Masks are still sacred in many traditional parts of Burkina Faso and are seen as a link to spirits and nature.                                                              These traditional parts of Burkina Faso are usually rural regions. They have relied on oral tradition to pass down poems, folk tales, songs, and more. It wasn’t until late into colonization that written literature came to the Burkinabe people, some of whom started to write down oral stories, mostly from the Mossi ethnic group.                                                              While cultural tradition and language have survived colonial rule, new problems are bringing Burkina Faso’s rich culture into demise. Most notably, young people are flocking to cities to find higher-paying jobs. These cities do not follow the traditional culture and are much more westernized. Second, the noble aspects of traditional Burkina Faso culture are disappearing as life becomes more difficult for the rural population. Third, climate change, internally displaced people, and terrorism forced some groups to have forgotten about living well and in harmony with nature.                                                              FarmSahel hopes to continue or bring back that ancient tradition of living in harmony with nature. Our programs are designed to help mitigate the effect of climate change, allow villages to better absorb the impact of migrants, and bring harmony back between the agriculturalists and their land.                                                                                                                            https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2016/3/13/in-burkina-faso-festima-a-festival-of-african-masks                               https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/burkina-faso/history-and-culture                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossi_people#:~:text=The%20Mossi)%20are%20a%20Gur,or%20about%2011.1%20million%20people.                               https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-culture-of-burkina-faso.html                               https://barkafoundation.org/burkina-faso-history-culture-climate-people-more/",

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month. These cases are reported to local authorities, and victims receive adequate medical care.</span> \n</span></p><p><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p></div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-6 medium-6 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1858156281\"\"> <div class=\"\"u_1577670191 imageWidget align-center\"\" data-element-type=\"\"image\"\" data-widget-type=\"\"image\"\" id=\"\"1577670191\"\" editablewidget=\"\"true\"\"><img src=\"\"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_8342-1920w.JPG\"\" alt=\"\"\"\" id=\"\"1427465577\"\" class=\"\"\"\" data-dm-image-path=\"\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/IMG_8342.JPG\"\" width=\"\"1284\"\" height=\"\"1500\"\" onerror=\"\"handleImageLoadError(this)\"\"></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1678401970\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1179073440\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 medium-12 large-12\"\" id=\"\"1909603167\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1143167176\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1143167176\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Kinda is a shining example of the resilience and hope the Burkinabe people carry with them no matter their hardships.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

        "Description": "Around the world, National parks are protecting sea creatures, insects, and fauna alike. In Burkina Faso, five national parks preserve the beauty of West African wildlife. One of the oldest National parks in Burkina Faso is called the Mare aux Hippopotames.                                                                         Established in 1937, the Mare aux Hippopotames became the only UNESCO Biosphere reserve in the nation. Formally established in 1977 and translated to ‘Lake of Hippopotamuses,’ it was created around a freshwater lake with other pools and marshes. It spans about 19,200 ha covering the floodplain of the black volta river. While the park’s main feature is the lake it is named after, the surrounding and protected galley forests have the most beneficial impact on the larger ecosystem. Galley forests form corridors along waterways, growing trees in regions that do not typically support tree growth. In these galley forests, Elephants, antelopes, primates, and hundreds of bird species can roam free. In addition, in the freshwater lake, crocodiles and a large population of hippopotamuses bring tourists to the region. Located in the southwest of Burkina Faso, the wildlife of Mare aux Hippopotames sees only four months of rainy weather, making the protection of the freshwater lake vital to the ecosystem.                                                              Moving east in Burkina Faso, located just north of the border of Ghana, is the second National Park of Burkina Faso, Kaborè Tambi National Park. Founded in 1976, the park follows the Nazinon river covering 155,500 ha. The large stretch of land has become a safe haven for wildlife, particularly birds, in Burkina Faso. But unfortunately, the park is not immune to poachers. In 1991, a ranger lost his life to poachers, and the park was renamed in his honor.                                                              Poachers have been a major issue throughout Africa since the discovery of ivory. Focusing on elephants, poachers are debilitating the population. The Deux Balès National Park was once home to the largest population of elephants in Burkina Faso in 2001. In 1937, as part of French West Africa, the area was named the Deux Balès Classified Forests. Unfortunately, the name is misleading, for this area was never designated as a national park. The area of the park ranges anywhere from 61,000 ha to 81,000 ha. While it is no longer home to a large population of elephants, the park is home to various flora. Most notably aging baobab trees. Native to Africa, baobab trees are widespread and can live up to 2,000 years. While this park is a haven for vegetation, without proper management, protection, and designation as a national park, wildlife continues to be threatened.                                                              The last set of national parks is a joint effort by multiple countries in West Africa. The first, Arli National Park, is located on the far east side of Burkina Faso, linking up with Benin’s Pendjari National Park. The Arli National Park holds a portion of the habitat home to Burkina Faso’s elephant population. The park is also home to hippopotamuses, lions, woodlands, gallery forests, and sandstone hills.                                                              Just north of Arli is W National Park, a major national park in West Africa encompassing three countries: Burkina Faso, Niger, and Bennin. Formally established in 1954, the park follows a bend of the River Niger that outlines a ‘W’ where the park gets its name. While the area is largely uninhabited due to wetlands that create a malaria zone, archaeological discoveries have shown humans once occupied the area. W National Park is significant not only for the 800,000 ha it protects but because of the wildlife living within it. The park is known for its large animals, such as the cheetah, buffalo, and aardvark. Most notably, W National Park is home to the most extensive grouping of the endangered West African Elephants.                                                              In 2016, the African elephant Status Report estimated that 6,850 elephants live in Burkina Faso. In 2003, the government of Burkina Faso at the time published an elephant management strategy that successfully increased the dying elephant population. Unfortunately, as the political situation degraded in Burkina Faso, so did the protection of these elephants. As a result, poaching carcasses have increased to about 50 - 86 per year.                                                              By actively establishing, protecting, and maintaining National Parks, we can continue to hope to see an increase in Africa’s biodiversity. However, we cannot rely on National Parks alone to protect our planet. It will take a considerable effort from everyone to keep temperatures low, keep species alive, and continue the harmony of the ecosystem. Through FarmSahel’s programs and the continued efforts of smallholder farmers implementing sustainable permaculture, FarmSahel will be able to revitalize and maintain the beautiful ecosystem of Africa.                                                              https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/SSC-OP-060_E.pdf                               https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-four-national-parks-of-burkina-faso.html                               https://discover-burkinafaso.com/national-parks/                               https://www.africatouroperators.org/burkina-faso/kabore-tambi-national-park                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deux_Bal%C3%A9s_National_Park                               https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/africa/mare-aux-hippopotames                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_National_Park                               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_Burkina_Faso#W_of_the_Niger_National_Park",

Africa’s vast and diverse wilderness is breathtaking but disappearing, and her population is growing but unstable. Yet, through all the hardships faced on the continent, the everyday people of Africa have shown their resilience and ability to keep looking forward, not giving up no matter the difficulties they face. As FarmSahel continues to help the everyday rural farmers of Burkina Faso, we must remember the dedication Burkinabe people have not to allow their uncontrollable situation stop them from achieving greatness.&nbsp;</div></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1549611605\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1739476572\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 large-6 medium-6\"\" id=\"\"1722783748\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1641564192\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1641564192\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"> <span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"></span> \n<span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">One recent example of greatness is the winner of the 2022 United Nations Women Police Office of the year. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month. These cases are reported to local authorities, and victims receive adequate medical care.</span> \n</span></p><p><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p></div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-6 medium-6 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1858156281\"\"> <div class=\"\"u_1577670191 imageWidget align-center\"\" data-element-type=\"\"image\"\" data-widget-type=\"\"image\"\" id=\"\"1577670191\"\" editablewidget=\"\"true\"\"><img src=\"\"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_8342-1920w.JPG\"\" alt=\"\"\"\" id=\"\"1427465577\"\" class=\"\"\"\" data-dm-image-path=\"\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/IMG_8342.JPG\"\" width=\"\"1284\"\" height=\"\"1500\"\" onerror=\"\"handleImageLoadError(this)\"\"></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1678401970\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1179073440\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 medium-12 large-12\"\" id=\"\"1909603167\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1143167176\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1143167176\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Kinda is a shining example of the resilience and hope the Burkinabe people carry with them no matter their hardships.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

        "Description": "While FarmSahel focuses on improving agriculture, Africa is also a continent rich in raw minerals. Mining has been a prime export of Africa starting around 1000 BCE in Northern Central Africa, where the Early Iron Age originated on the continent. Before the scramble for Africa by European nations, explorers saw the multitude of mines for precious metals from gold to copper. Unfortunately, not every African civilization had access to the income that luxurious metals brought. Even in 2022, Africa is still a major source of minerals that spread around the globe. Unfortunately, even now, people are being exploited to extract those minerals.                                             Commonly referred to as 3T minerals: tin, tantalum, and tungsten. The 3T minerals are essential to creating standard technology. They are relied on by major companies such as Apple, Tesla, Intel, and Microsoft. As the technology boom flourished and a focus on better batteries and smaller components came to fruition, so did the question of ethical sourcing. In 2009, a group of organizations created the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative or the ITSCI. It aims to create a reliable and ethical supply chain for the 3T minerals. Through a system of government validation of mines, audits, and specialty tagging, companies and countries would be able to know that these minerals came from ethical mines. Most mines for the 3T minerals come from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. It is also from these two countries that most conflict minerals are making it to market.                                                                    A conflict mineral comes from a mine that is exploiting its workers. Usually, this means an armed militia group has taken control of the mine where they can use child labor, force nearby towns to work, and ignore any safety precautions. These mines are a vital source of income for these militia groups. With the ability to launder minerals into the overall market, violence has raged for control of the mines. Militia groups are vying for more mines to increase their income, with no accountability for smuggling minerals onto the international stage.                                                                    In 2014, the ITSCI government first recognized the contamination of conflict minerals in the international market. Then, in 2015, the Congolese NGO Max Impact also alleged that conflict minerals were making it past the ITSCI verification and into the market. Now, decades later, Global Witness has evidence that only 20% of the 83 tons of 3T minerals have come from validated mines. Most of the contamination comes from the east of the DRC near the border with Rwanda. In addition, Global Witness and other NGOs continuously find that mines are tagging much more minerals than they have produced.                                                                    Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a solution in sight. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development determined that the ITSCI verification system aligns with its due diligence despite continued evidence from NGOs and Watchdog groups. In addition, Global Witness found new evidence suggesting that ITSCI individuals frequently downplay or ignore incidents of contamination that seriously affect the supply chain. Furthermore, according to the UN, highly underpaid governmental employees often participate in smuggling. With minimal field staff and an extreme lack of oversight from the ITSCI, it is difficult to see a clear solution.                                                                    Global Witness listed a list of potential reforms that can get conflict minerals out of the international supply. Unfortunately, major companies are contempt at trusting the mechanism in place, which has proven to fail. Reforming the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative is a necessary first step to avoiding conflicts of interest. Second, Global Witness calls for validated mines to be transparent in their mineral production data.                                                                     We must rely on the action of NGOs and groups like Global Witness to continue to bring this lawlessness to light. Mining is already a life-threatening job, but we rely on the precious minerals in our everyday lives. It is not impossible to have a world where companies can trace all minerals back to an ethically sourced mine!                                                                     https://news.mongabay.com/2022/05/scheme-to-stop-conflict-minerals-fails-to-end-child-labor-in-drc-report-says/                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/natural-resource-governance/itsci-laundromat/#key-recommendations                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/20347/The_ITSCI_Laundromat_-_April_2022.pdf                                                                    https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/conflict-minerals/#:~:text=The%20global%20minerals%20trade%20has,supply%20chains%20and%20mitigating%20harms.",

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

        "Description": "In December 2015, the 21st Conference of Parties was held in Paris, where 196 countries signed the Paris Climate Agreement. In short, this agreement brings most nations together to develop and implement ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, many climate activities do not believe the agreement goes far enough. First, each country must act on its own accord and set its greenhouse gas targets. Second, the plans that were introduced in 2015 were not aggressive enough to combat the 1.5 degrees Celsius the Paris Climate Agreement is trying to avoid. Third, after almost six years of the Paris Climate Agreement, we have seen that countries are not taking the extreme measures needed to limit emissions.                                                                   While the Paris agreement may not have been the answer to the most pressing issue humanity faces, COP21 produced another lesser-known initiative. The 4 per 1000 initiative was launched by France in December 2015 aimed as a grassroots effort to show the importance agricultural soils have in reducing climate change and increasing food security. The 4 per 1000 initiative is strictly voluntary, but, unlike the Paris agreement, it targets everybody from states, companies, NGOs, and non-profit organizations to implement actions for soil carbon storage.                                                                          The 4 per 1000 initiative focuses on the benefits of soil carbon storage that turn greenhouse gas emissions from plants into nutrients for the soil. Its name comes from the target increase to significantly improve soil vitality. Scientific research shows that an annual 0.4% increase in soil carbon retention will significantly reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Currently, the world’s soil stock is storing 1,500 billion tons of carbon in the form of organic matter. Soil is able to store carbon dioxide from plants that have pulled the greenhouse gas in through photosynthesis. When the plant dies, organic matter from the soil breaks down the plant, storing the CO2, and creating a more nutritious and healthier soil layer.                                                                          While 1,500 billion tons of CO2 sounds like a lot, it does not compete in scale of the 36.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from human activities in 2019. Each year, that amount increases by 4.3 billion tons. A rate that is hard to slow down and almost impossible to capture. Additionally, soil degradation is increasing while the weather turns extreme to heat waves and floods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that 75% of soils are already degraded in varying degrees due to human activities.                                                                          In this dire situation, the 4 per 1000 initiative gives everybody the opportunity to work towards reducing climate change. 4 per 1000 focuses on increasing the ability of soil to store carbon, which will increase the soil’s health. The initiative lists ways farmers worldwide can better protect and support their soil:                                                                          • Never leave soil bare.                                     • Use no-tilling methods of farming.                                     • Grow more cover crops.                                     • Develop agroforestry.                                     • Optimize pasture management.                                     • Improve water and fertilizer management.                                                                          The 4 per 1000 initiative lists these as ways to start enriching and protecting our soils from further damage. Not only storing greenhouse gasses but increasing food security through healthier soil.                                     FarmSahel has already implemented most of these recommendations in Burkina Faso. However, we have the added task of having to restore soil vitality before protecting its nutrients. FarmSahel will continue to implement these recommendations to restore soil nutrients, and we hope with our commitment to the 4per1000 initiative, we can continue to highlight the importance of sustainable permaculture.                                      FarmSahel has joined this grassroots effort to show the world how vital soil health is. Nutritious soil will benefit the climate, biodiversity, farmers, and families.

Africa’s vast and diverse wilderness is breathtaking but disappearing, and her population is growing but unstable. Yet, through all the hardships faced on the continent, the everyday people of Africa have shown their resilience and ability to keep looking forward, not giving up no matter the difficulties they face. As FarmSahel continues to help the everyday rural farmers of Burkina Faso, we must remember the dedication Burkinabe people have not to allow their uncontrollable situation stop them from achieving greatness.&nbsp;</div></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1549611605\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1739476572\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 large-6 medium-6\"\" id=\"\"1722783748\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1641564192\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1641564192\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"> <span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"></span> \n<span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">One recent example of greatness is the winner of the 2022 United Nations Women Police Office of the year. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month. These cases are reported to local authorities, and victims receive adequate medical care.</span> \n</span></p><p><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p></div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-6 medium-6 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1858156281\"\"> <div class=\"\"u_1577670191 imageWidget align-center\"\" data-element-type=\"\"image\"\" data-widget-type=\"\"image\"\" id=\"\"1577670191\"\" editablewidget=\"\"true\"\"><img src=\"\"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_8342-1920w.JPG\"\" alt=\"\"\"\" id=\"\"1427465577\"\" class=\"\"\"\" data-dm-image-path=\"\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/IMG_8342.JPG\"\" width=\"\"1284\"\" height=\"\"1500\"\" onerror=\"\"handleImageLoadError(this)\"\"></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1678401970\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1179073440\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 medium-12 large-12\"\" id=\"\"1909603167\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1143167176\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1143167176\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Kinda is a shining example of the resilience and hope the Burkinabe people carry with them no matter their hardships.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering. Since then, his architecture has always had a design that was in harmony with the world around it.</span> \n</span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Kéré stated that he uses local resources and participatory design methods to create contemporary architecture with an afro-futurist vision. As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school. With the help of his friends and community Kéré has left an inspiring legacy for the next generation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\" style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda and Diébédo Francis Kéré are two examples of outstanding leaders and exceptional inspirations for people around the world.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children. Before arriving in Mali, no cases of sexual violence were reported; after Chief Warrant Officer Kinda’s work, they are receiving up to three reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence a month. These cases are reported to local authorities, and victims receive adequate medical care.</span> \n</span></p><p><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p></div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-6 medium-6 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1858156281\"\"> <div class=\"\"u_1577670191 imageWidget align-center\"\" data-element-type=\"\"image\"\" data-widget-type=\"\"image\"\" id=\"\"1577670191\"\" editablewidget=\"\"true\"\"><img src=\"\"https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/opt/IMG_8342-1920w.JPG\"\" alt=\"\"\"\" id=\"\"1427465577\"\" class=\"\"\"\" data-dm-image-path=\"\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/a652d47c/dms3rep/multi/IMG_8342.JPG\"\" width=\"\"1284\"\" height=\"\"1500\"\" onerror=\"\"handleImageLoadError(this)\"\"></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1678401970\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1179073440\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol small-12 medium-12 large-12\"\" id=\"\"1909603167\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1143167176\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1143167176\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Kinda is a shining example of the resilience and hope the Burkinabe people carry with them no matter their hardships.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering. Since then, his architecture has always had a design that was in harmony with the world around it.</span> \n</span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Kéré stated that he uses local resources and participatory design methods to create contemporary architecture with an afro-futurist vision. As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school. With the help of his friends and community Kéré has left an inspiring legacy for the next generation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\" style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda and Diébédo Francis Kéré are two examples of outstanding leaders and exceptional inspirations for people around the world.

In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali. There she worked alongside Malian Security Forces to promote and improve the rights of women and children.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering. Since then, his architecture has always had a design that was in harmony with the world around it.</span> \n</span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">Kéré stated that he uses local resources and participatory design methods to create contemporary architecture with an afro-futurist vision. As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school.

Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda grew up in Burkina Faso. She was always focused on protecting and promoting Women’s and Children’s rights. In Burkina Faso, she worked with the Ministry of Security as an investigator on sexual violence and exploitation. She also worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2013 and 2015, leading the UN mission on gender rights. Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda won this award because of her peacekeeping work in the neighboring country of Mali.

He is an internationally renowned architect and won multiple awards throughout his long career. Most recently, in 2022, he won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker Prize is often referred to as the architecture Nobel Prize. The prize has been awarded annually since 1979 and looks for architects whose work is extraordinary with consistent and significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. In 2022, Diébédo Francis Kéré was the first African to have ever won this award. He has imagined and created magnificent buildings that touch every corner of the world. However, it did not start like this, he began in the small village of Gando in Burkina Faso before going to Berlin for official schooling. In 2001 Kéré returned to Burkina Faso and designed the first primary school in the Gando village.</span> \n</span></p></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n <div class=\"\"dmRespRow blog-post-row\"\" id=\"\"1826692163\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespColsWrapper\"\" id=\"\"1937701253\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmRespCol large-12 medium-12 small-12\"\" id=\"\"1445809044\"\"> <div class=\"\"dmNewParagraph u_1864534945\"\" data-element-type=\"\"paragraph\"\" data-version=\"\"5\"\" id=\"\"1864534945\"\" style=\"\"transition: none 0s ease 0s; text-align: left; display: block;\"\"><p style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\" class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span class=\"\"\"\" style=\"\"display: unset;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: unset;\"\">With the help of the community, creating almost every part of the school by hand, Kéré fused indigenous materials with modern engineering.

As he grew in success and fame, Kéré never forgot about his humble beginnings and the importance of the community that helped him. He explained his desire to give to the next generation, and he feels that he must support his community. Diébédo Francis Kéré is a shining example of the resilience and determination the Burkinabe people have. Kéré grew up in Gando village and was the first child from the village to be sent to school. With the help of his friends and community Kéré has left an inspiring legacy for the next generation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\"><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\"><br></span></p><p class=\"\"text-align-justify\"\" style=\"\"line-height: 1.2;\"\"><span style=\"\"display: initial;\"\">Chief Warrant Officer Alizéta Kabore Kinda and Diébédo Francis Kéré are two examples of outstanding leaders and exceptional inspirations for people around the world.
